Context Annual Health Survey (AHS) 2012-13 was conducted in Empowered Action Group (EAG) states i.e. Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh & Madhya Pradesh and Assam. These nine states account for about 48% of the total population and 59% of new Births. As per GOI, the purpose of the survey is: “The objective of the AHS is to yield a comprehensive, representative and reliable dataset on core vital indicators including composite ones like Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Ratio and Total Fertility Rate along with their co-variates (process and outcome indicators) at the district level and map the changes therein on an annual basis. These benchmarks would help in better and holistic understanding and timely monitoring of various determinants on well-being and health of population particularly Reproductive and Child Health” GOI also maintains Census Data & Socio Economic Caste Census Data and many of the variables covered in the former overlap with those covered by AHS. National Health Systems Resource Centre (NHRC) has the data about the state of health facilities in a district. It provides comprehensive information in terms of number of facilities, type/level of facility (PHC/SHC/THC), accessibility, trend (growing/stagnant/depreciating) etc. Further GOI had categorized districts as-Red, Orange, Greendepending on the basis of severity of Covid-19. Data about spread and effect of Covid-19 in these districts is also available in terms of infected, recovered and deaths. All these information gathering help policy makers assess the situation on ground, evaluate progress of past/ongoing schemes & efforts and make data driven decisions for the future.

What are the gaps that provide window for improvement? These data repositories are quite extensive in themselves and provide useful info, but there still are laggings which prevent their utilization to full potential. Following are some of the aforementioned shortcomings/ limitations:

Annual Health Survey is limited in coverage. It covers only 9 states. Both Census of India & Socio Economic Caste Census make available the macroeconomic & demographic data for remaining 20 states and 7 UTs. By deriving the relationship between macroeconomic & demographic data and the composite health indicator, via regression analysis on the AHS data, we would be able to predict the aforementioned indicators for the remaining states.
These repositories sit in silos. Most of the analysis done on them is based on their data alone. This could be due to inter departmental compartmentalisations. Using them simultaneously will allow such cross functional analysis which isn’t possible using any of the repositories alone. The effect of combining these repositories would not be summation of potential but synergy of potentials.
